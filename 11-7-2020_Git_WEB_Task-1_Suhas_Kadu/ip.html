	<p>Image Processing<br />
	Image processing is a method to perform some operations on an image, in order to get an enhanced image<br />
	or to extract some useful information from it. It is a type of signal processing in which input is an <br />
	image and output may be image or characteristics/features associated with that image.Nowadays, image <br />
	processing is among rapidly growing technologies.

	<br />
	
	<p>		In  this Project I have OpenCV.When user clicks anywhere on the image he gets the color and RGB value of that<br /> 
	pixel.This project is  base for many image drawing and image processing applications.</p>
